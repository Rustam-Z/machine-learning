# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

    - Building and training with TensorFlow and Keras
    - Architectures: feedforward for tabular data, CNN for computer vision, RNN and LSTM for sequence processing
    - Encoder / decoder and Transformers for NLP
    - Autoencoders and generative Adversarial Network (GANs) for generative learning
    - Techniques for training DNN
    - Reinforcement learning - building agent to play a game
    - Loading and preprocessing large amount of data
    - Training and deploying at scale
