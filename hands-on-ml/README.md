Rustam-ZðŸš€ â€¢ 29 May 2021

Hello, I am Rustam. Here, you can find my notes on `Hands-on Machine Learning` book. Use `TIP!` in searching bar to find tips while developing ML system. 

## Roadmap
- **Part I, The Fundamentals of Machine Learning, End-to-end ML process**
    - Handling, cleaning, and preparing data.
    - Selecting and engineering features.
    - Learning by fitting a model to data.
    - Optimizing a cost function.
    - Selecting a model and tuning hyperparameters using cross-validation.
    - Underfitting and overfitting (the bias/variance tradeoff).
    - Unsupervised learning techniques: clustering, density estimation and anomaly detection.
    - Algorithms: Linear and Polynomial Regression, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Ensemble methods.
- **Part II, Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
    - Building and training with TensorFlow and Keras
    - Architectures: feedforward for tabular data, CNN for computer vision, RNN and LSTM for sequence processing
    - Encoder / decoder and Transformers for NLP
    - Autoencoders and GANs for generative learning
    - Techniques for training DNN
    - Reinforcement learning - building agent to play a game
    - Loading and preprocessing large amount of data
    - Training and deploying at scale
