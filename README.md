## Why should you learn Machine Learning?
I found two good answers on why you should care. Firstly, **Machine Learning (ML)** is making computers do things that we’ve never made computers do before. If you want to do something new, not just new to you, but to the world, you can do it with ML.

Secondly, if you don’t influence the world, the world will influence you.

If you focus on results, you will never change. 
If you focus on change, you will get results.

## How to study?

## Path to FAANG! 
First, need to gain basic knowledge in Data Science and Machine learning:
    - Follow my roadmap (ML, DL, DS, TF (Hands-on))
    - Course, practice, books
    - Kaggle

Then, move to FAANG preperation (#algorithms, #systems_design and #behavior):
    - Cracking the coding interview, LeetCode
    - https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university
