# Machine Learning Area
Hi everyone, I am Rustam, these days I feel like I need to brush up on my knowledge of ML & DL, so I decided to build a kind of roadmap for mastering ML from the very beginning. We will cover all the basic theory, then move to the processing for applying the gained knowlendge to create AI products.

> The goal is not learning Machine Learning, the goal is to learn how to build software with ML models. The goal is to become a machine learning problem solver, learn how to apply machine learning solutions, optimize for your own cases and environment, and solve real life problems.

I have a telegram channel, where I post all interesting stuff about AI. (https://t.me/rz_zokirov_ml)

## Why Should You Use Machine Learning?
I found two good answers on why you should care. Firstly, Machine Learning (ML) is making computers do things that we’ve never made computers do before. If you want to do something new, not just new to you, but to the world, you can do it with ML.

Secondly, if you don’t influence the world, the world will influence you.
