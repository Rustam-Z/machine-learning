# Machine Learning Area
Hi everyone, I am Rustam, these days I feel like I need to brush up on my knowledge of ML & DL, so I decided to write a kind of book for mastering ML from the very beginning. We will cover all the basic theory, then move to the processing for applying the gained knowlendge to create AI products.

> The goal is to become a machine learning problem solver, learn how to apply machine learning solutions, optimize for your own cases and environment, and solve real life problems.
