# Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow

## Roadmap
- Part I, *The Fundamentals of Machine Learning*
    - What is Machine Learning? What problems does it try to solve? What are the main categories and fundamental concepts of Machine Learning systems?
    - The main steps in a typical Machine Learning project.
    - Learning by fitting a model to data.
    - Optimizing a cost function.
    - Handling, cleaning, and preparing data.
    - Selecting and engineering features.
    - Selecting a model and tuning hyperparameters using cross-validation.
    - The main challenges of Machine Learning, in particular underfitting and overfit‐ ting (the bias/variance tradeoff).
    - Reducing the dimensionality of the training data to fight the curse of dimension‐ ality.
    - Other unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering, density estimation and anomaly detection.
    - The most common learning algorithms: Linear and Polynomial Regression, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Ensemble methods.
